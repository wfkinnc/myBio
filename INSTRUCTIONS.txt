STEPS FOR SETTING UP GITHUB REPO AND PUSHING YOUR PROJECT

---- from your browser

1. Login to your github account

2. Select the 'drop down' on the menu to 'create a new repository'

3. On the create a new repository form ---

> enter the name of your new repository (ie mybio)
> enter a description

Select Public

DO NOT initialize this repository with readme, .gitignore or license

We will create and push those files from your local machine

4 Select 'Create repository'

5 copy the url with the path to your github repo. It will be located in Quick setup section

------ on your machine

1. cd to the root of your project (ie - mybio)

2. execute the command 

git init

3. execute the command 

git remote add origin <paste your url from step 5 above here>

4 execute the sequence of commands to stage your files, commit to your local repo and push to the remote repo

git add .
git commit -m "intializing my bio repo"
git push origin master

5. Caution! Note that git add has a spce and "." following it. It means add ALL the files from this repo to the staging area

-------- refresh your browser and view your project on Gihub!!

NOTE - In README.ms and CONTRIBUTING.md are links to an image and issues repository.

As a Bonus, update those links with the correct urls -- pointing to the chat bot image in your repo and pointing to the issues tab for your repo issues
